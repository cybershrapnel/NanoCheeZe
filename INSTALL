Building NanoCheeZe on Linux! Ubuntu 14 and 16 and 18+

Currently NanoCheeZe can be easily compiled and ran on Ubuntu 14/16 and now 18+ by entering the following two commands in a terminal window.
Step 1:
wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cybershrapnel/NanoCheeZe/master/build_ncz"
Step 2:
on ubuntu 16 and below just type the following command in a terminal after doing step 1.
bash build_ncz
or
(Ubuntu 18 and up)
bash build_ncz_ubuntu18

enter you user password or type Y if prompted...
(you can type n and not install packages, maybe you have what we need already?)

It's that easy!

(modify build_ncz, after doing wget, as needed if you need/want your system updated/upgraded., etc)

Not tested on Debian directly but Gitian build from debian works for building windows exe.
I recently fixed the build_ncz script so it now runs on version 14 and 16 of ubuntu! Previously would only compile on 14.
