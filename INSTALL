Building NanoCheeZe on Linux! Ubuntu 14

Currently NanoCheeZe can be easily compiled and ran on Ubuntu 14.04 by bashing the install script.
Step 1:
wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cybershrapnel/NanoCheeZe/master/build_ncz"
Step 2:
bash build_ncz

enter password or type Y if prompted...

It's that easy!

(modify build_nc, after doing wget, as needed if you need/want your system updated/upgraded., etc)


--------

Ubuntu 16 and 18

If you have build instructions, Please share them, The HoboNickels community would like them as well...


--------

For Windows

Download the Windows exe from http://nanocheeze.com/NanoCheeZe-qt.exe

gitian (debian/ubuntu) compile instructions for the windows exe build coming soon...

I have only ever compiled the windows exe from a gitian ubuntu/debian environment and it's not easy.


--------

For Mac

Goto China... 
lol, No, but really, macOSX build instructions are the same as for HoboNickels which is the same as many other coins. No need to duplicate information.
